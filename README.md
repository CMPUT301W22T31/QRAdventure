# QRAdventure


Notes for part 3:


  * If the QR picture is of low quality on the emulator, somtimes scanning won't work
  
  * Javadoc can be found in the main project folder

*   Occasionally with the emulator camera the screen may appear black. This is because the camera has somehow gone outside the testing room, so if you look around you should be able to eventually see the room

* Accessing a feature which was not implemented in part 3 may result in a crash

* We have some fragment classes which are just clones of activities. These are unused for now.
