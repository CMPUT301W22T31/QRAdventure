# QRAdventure


Notes for part 3:


  * If the QR picture is of low quality on the emulator, somtimes scanning won't work
  
  * We were unable to generate the Javadoc HTML due to an unknown error, but all the methods should have javadoc style comments

*   Occasianly with the emulator camera the screen may appear black. This is because the camera has somehow gone outside the testing room, so if you look around you should be able to eventually see the room

* Accessing a feature which was not implemented in part 3 may result in a crash
